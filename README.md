## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset used in this project was collected from statistics released by the National Hockey League from 1909 to 2011. Data provided includes names, scoring statistics, team statistics, awards statistics and much more, providing a wide scope of the impact of players, teams and coaches over this 102 year period. This dataset is intended to help understand the past of the national hockey league in order to promote the future. This data is more limited the closer to 1909 it gets, as the National Hockey League collected less advanced stats and less of the modern awards were existed or presented. The data for the 2004 season will also be very limited as, due to labor disputes, the season was cancelled and therefore, stats were not recorded. Personally this dataset will be mostly for enjoyment purposes as I am an avid hockey fan - have been for most of my life - and I personally really enjoy using statistics to measure the value of players and the strengths of teams.
