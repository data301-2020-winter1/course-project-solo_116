# Group 116 Dealing with Covid - an Analysis of the Spread and Mortality of the Novel Coronavirus in Korea

## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Project Description

The topic of this project is on Coronavirus patient transmission and mortality in Korea between January and June of 2020. My interest in this project stems from a concern in the speed of the transmission rates of covid and wanting to learn of the earlier handling of the virus in foreign countries. I am also interested to learn how martality rates are correlated with certain age ranges and also the overall mortality rate in this particular dataset. This topic is one that is currently on the minds of all people across the globe and I hope to learn something to gain some peace of mind, or perhaps learn of any previously unrealized concerns. Th e dataset being used provides, when possible, the patient ID of the individual you spread the virus to them, which interests me, because I like to be able to track the spread and see how many individuals are typically infected by a patient. This dataset would conform nicely to a user-faced dashboard as there are several attributes which can be represented in a variety of visual ways.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project was collected from statistics released by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) between January and June of 2020. Data provided includes patient ID, contraction date, who the individual was infected by, state (i.e. released, deceased, etc.) and a variety of other categories providing a detailed scope of the spread and effects of the virous over this period. This dataset is intended to describe the transmission of the virus and the recovery, or lack thereof, based on the age of the patient and other factors. The main limits of this data are the information that are simply not known; some cases were unable to be tracked to the source, the majority of patients who have died from the virus have not had all information released to the public and as the virus got more and more out of control, the data was more difficult to keep up with and share with the public. This dataset will provide a detailed picture of the spread of covid during this period in Korea and will hopefully help in educating people on the virus.
