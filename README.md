## Project Description

The topic of this project is on statistics recorded by National Hockey League from 1909 to 2011. My interest in this project stems from my long held obsession with hockey and using statistics as a measure of players and teams. As an analytical person, using a dataset such as this to evaluate current and past players certainly interests me and I am hoping for some surprises in the data. My favourite hockey player is Connor McDavid and one interesting question I would like to answer is how he compares to the top players in the league's history, such as Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Gordie Howe and Sidney Crosby. Another question I would like to answer is what makes a team a Stanley Cup winner; what is the best measure of the prospect of team success. This topic should be perfect for a user-facing dashboard, as the data is fairly concrete in its representation and should translate well to this type of interface. 

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project was collected from statistics released by the National Hockey League from 1909 to 2011. Data provided includes names, scoring statistics, team statistics, awards statistics and much more, providing a wide scope of the impact of players, teams and coaches over this 102 year period. This dataset is intended to help understand the past of the national hockey league in order to promote the future. This data is more limited the closer to 1909 it gets, as the National Hockey League collected less advanced stats and less of the modern awards were existed or presented. The data for the 2004 season will also be very limited as, due to labor disputes, the season was cancelled and therefore, stats were not recorded. Personally this dataset will be mostly for enjoyment purposes as I am an avid hockey fan - have been for most of my life - and I personally really enjoy using statistics to measure the value of players and the strengths of teams.
